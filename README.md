# 🚀 MoS-ai - Next.js Powerhouse 

**Your friendly neighborhood AI playground** built with Next.js. Because why build simple when you can over-engineer with modern tech?

```bash
# Choose your adventure:
npm run dev    # For the pure souls
yarn dev       # For the hipsters
pnpm dev       # For the speed demons
bun dev        # For the rebels
```

## 🧩 What's Cooking?

- Next.js 14 - Because we like shiny things

- TypeScript - For those who enjoy yelling at red squiggles

- Modern Architecture - Folders organized by how much coffee I've had

- AI Ready - Coming soon to a terminal near you
